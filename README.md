## A network-based competitive server for multi-agent environments in Reinforcement Learning

The goal of this project is to build a competitive ranking system much like many video games have nowadays, but then for Reinforcement learning agents.

Features:
 - Agents run in their own threads and can connect and disconnect whenever necessary (DONE/UNTESTED serverside)
 - Agents can be run from multiple devices since everything is network based (netcode WIP)
 - The server runs games and matches players based on rank (DONE)
 - The server holds a rank for each player using the amazing "_barely working_" ranking system (DONE)
 - Ranks can be seen using a "nice" web interface (DONE, just connect to the server via a webbrowser)
